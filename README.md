## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

My major lesson from this project was the use of certain Javascript  functions like getTime() to aid in particular web page styling.

I also learned about a CSS property known as z-index to overlay one HTML element over another, especially images.


### Continued development

Media query is still a major challenge for me and this project should not have been this difficult for me. Mobile responsiveness is still an area I wish to develop myself in.


## Acknowledgments

Shoutout to Cyprian for helping me out with the code for real-time display of the countdown without reloading the page.
